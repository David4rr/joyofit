/**
 * Watches that give no sleep stages (Huawei Watch Fit 2: only `sleep_state.bin`) store one stage-less range per
 * TruSleep state record. Those records are the watch's sensor windows, not a verdict of "asleep": a 1-minute HRV or
 * stress check, and a workout started on the watch, both open such windows (see `SleepSync.segmentsFromState`).
 *
 * This is the rule that tells them apart again, on stage-less segments only (a segment with a stage came from the
 * watch's own sleep analysis and is never touched). Same rule as `cleanUnstagedSleep` in
 * src/features/sleep/cleanSleep.ts and `SleepCleaning` in SleepCleaning.swift; keep the three and their constants together.
 *
 *  1. Awake evidence is subtracted from the stage-less ranges: a stored workout, a stored spot HRV measurement, and
 *     every minute with [ACTIVE_STEPS_PER_MIN] steps or more.
 *  2. What is left is chained into runs (pieces at most [RUN_BRIDGE_SEC] apart). A run holding less than [MIN_RUN_SEC]
 *     of sleep is dropped.
 *  3. A kept segment that follows a workout, or that follows another stage-less segment after more than
 *     [UNSTAGED_BREAK_SEC] of nothing, is marked [SleepSegment.breakBefore]; every session builder starts a new
 *     session there, whatever the 3 h session gap says.
